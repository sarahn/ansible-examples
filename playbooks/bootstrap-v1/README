Edit inventory to match your hosts.

/tmp, /var, and /home are often mounted 'noexec'
ansible needs a directory on an 'exec' mount.

This playbook does the following: 
* Creates a temporary directory with name '/ansible' 
* Sets temporary directory permissions 770 for root:<wheel or sudo> 
* Adds the login user to the group <wheel or sudo>

Run this playbook with:
ansible-playbook -i inventory [ -u user ] [ -K if sudo pass ] [ -k if ssh pass ] -v <platform>-bootstrap.yml

Test with:
ansible -i inventory '<hosts>' [ -u user ] [ -K if sudo pass ] [ -k if ssh pass ] -m setup
