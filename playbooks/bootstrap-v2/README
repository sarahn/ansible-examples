Edit inventory to match your hosts.

/tmp, /var, and /home are often mounted 'noexec'
ansible needs a directory on an 'exec' mount.

This playbook does the following: 
* Creates a temporary directory with default name '/ansible' 
* Sets temporary directory permissions 770 for root:<wheel or sudo> 
* Adds the login user to the group <wheel or sudo>

Sudo permissions are required to run this playbook.

The location of '/ansible' may be overridden with another directory by performing the following:

* Add --extra-vars='tmpdir=/full/path/to/directory' to the command line

To use this temporary directory for other playbooks, edit ansible.cfg to contain
[defaults]
remote_tmp = /full/path/to/directory

Run this playbook with:
ansible-playbook [ -u user ] [ -K if sudo pass ] [ -k if ssh pass ] -v bootstrap.yml

Test with:
ansible 'all' [ -u user ] [ -K if sudo pass ] [ -k if ssh pass ] -vvv -m script -a 'scripts/test.sh' -t test
